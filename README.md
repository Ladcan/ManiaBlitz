# ManiaBlitz
Repository for the rhythm game ManiaBlitz, which the code is currently closed sourced!

This is strictly used as an issue tracker ( Meaning you only report bugs here by using the issues page. )
If you have any suggestions to give, please talk to me! Either through my discord or maniablitznet using the 'Send A Message' feature in-game.

I want to release the code in the future. But its really sloppy right now, so give me time to improve the code of the game.

Visit or download the game at [Itch.io](https://ladcan.itch.io/maniablitz)
